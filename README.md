# ns-tracker

[![Build Status](https://github.com/weavejester/ns-tracker/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavejester/ns-tracker/actions/workflows/test.yml)

ns-tracker is a Clojure library for keeping track of changes to source
files and their associated namespaces. This is usually used to
automatically reload modified namespaces in a running Clojure
application.

It is derived from code in Stuart Sierra's [Lazytest][1] tool, and the
credit for writing the vast majority of the code used in this library
should therefore go to him.

## Installation

As usual, to use this library, add the following dependency to your
`project.clj` file:

    [ns-tracker "0.4.0"]

## Usage

Use the `ns-tracker.core/ns-tracker` function to create a new tracker
function for one or more source directories:

    (use 'ns-tracker.core)

    (def modified-namespaces
      (ns-tracker ["src" "test"]))

When you call the `modified-namespaces` function, it will return a list
of Clojure namespaces that have changed. You can then reload them on
the fly:

    (doseq [ns-sym (modified-namespaces)]
      (require ns-sym :reload))

This can be placed in a background thread, or triggered by some user
request.

### Declaring Dependencies to Static Resources

Some Clojure libraries, such as
[HugSQL](https://www.hugsql.org/#using-def-db-fns), define functions in
a namespace based on the content of a static resource file. ns-tracker
is able to reload such a namespace when the resource file is modified
with the help of a bit metadata.

You will need to declare the resources under the
`:ns-tracker/resource-deps` key in the namespace's metadata:

    (ns example.db
      {:ns-tracker/resource-deps ["sql/queries.sql"]}
      (:require example.utils))

The resource path needs to be relative to one of the source directories
which you gave as a parameter to the `ns-tracker.core/ns-tracker`
function.
